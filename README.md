Final Project for MPM2D2 - Future Careers in Mathematics

This is the final project for my grade 11 math class, MPM2D2 Principles of Mathematics. I took this class because my level of algebra  was bothering me and I didn't like the 
feeling.

As a part of this class, we were required to write a research report on future careers in mathematics. 

I decided to challenge myself and create a web page for my final project. I had just started learning HTML and CSS, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to put my skills to use. This project helped me to develop my coding skills.

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide information about future careers in mathematics. The web page includes different career options, along with their descriptions, salary ranges, and job outlook. I have also included some tips on how to prepare for these careers and what skills are required to excel in them.

The web page is easy to navigate and user-friendly. I have included links to external resources for further reading and research.
Technologies Used

    HTML

Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. It allowed me to finally return to coding during the final week of the class and its actually something that is informative. I hope this web page will be helpful for anyone interested in pursuing a career in mathematics.

PS. I was newer then and was winging it with Git. My commits are going to look crazier over time probably. Just pointing out that I know :)
