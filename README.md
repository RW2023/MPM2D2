Final Project for MPM2D2 - Future Careers in Mathematics

This is the final project for my grade 11 math class, MPM2D2 Principles of Mathematics. I took this class because my level of algebra understanding was bothering me, and I wanted to improve my skills.

As a part of this class, we were required to write a research report on future careers in mathematics. I found this assignment interesting as it allowed me to explore different career opportunities that are available in the field of mathematics.

I decided to challenge myself and create a web page for my final project. I had just started learning HTML and CSS, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to put my skills to use. This project helped me to develop my coding skills, and I am proud of what I have accomplished.
